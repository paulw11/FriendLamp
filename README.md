# FriendLamp
Micropython code for the [FriendLamp project](https://www.instructables.com/Friend-Lamp-Stay-in-Touch-With-Light/)

The Friend Lamp lets someone know you are thinking of them with just a touch. 

This simple lamp glows with a colour. Touch the top and the colours change. When you see a colour you like, let go. The colour you have chosen will be sent to your friend's lamp. 

They will see the colour change and know that you were thinking of them.
